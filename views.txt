VIEWS 
	Views are created in order to store your queries as virtual
	table. If there are a lot of columns and we donâ€™t want to
	use all columns and make the table simpler, we can create a
	view and reuse it repeatedly. Actually, view does not store
	any data however, it contains the retrieve statements to
	provide re-usability. We can create view if we use some
	queries mostly.

		CREATE VIEW EmployeeInfo as
		select first_name || last_name as "Full Name"
		from employees;
